## Datatypes
Starts with Capital letter & every type has helper methods (similar to C#)
* **Int** (default, 32-bit signed, -231 to 231-1)
* **Long** (64-bit signed, -263 to 263-1)
* **Double** (default, double precision, 64-bit floating point)
* **Float** (single-precision 32-bit floating point)
* **Number** (allows to assign both integer and floating-point value one at a time)
* **Byte** (8-bit signed, -128 to 127)
* **Short** (16-bit signed, -32768 to 32767)
* **Boolean**
* **Char** (unlike java, can not be treated as `Int`)
* **String**

## Variable
* `var` keyword to declare variable
* `val` keyword to declare read-only variable (also for constant)
```kotlin
var x: Int = 10;
var x = 10 // type inference
val PI = 3.1416;
```
